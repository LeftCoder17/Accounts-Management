# Accounts_Management
## Description
This is my first app I have tried to develop with Qt and is still unfinished. However, I upload it while I develop it in case someone finds it useful.

The aim of the app is to manage your accounts and money, not only to have a control of the incomes and payments, but also to be able to analyse them. The analysis part is still missing though.

## Some comments
1. Notice that the labels and text the the user read are in Catalan, as I want to use it for me. Nevertheless, the code is perfectly readable (at least I hope so) :)

2. The labels implementation for the types and subtypes seem weird and, indeed, is weird. What happens is that I want to publish the code but I don't fancy sharing my personal labels, so this way I maintain it confidential inside of the code. The external "labels.txt" in the libs directory is an example of how this file does look like and it is completely adaptable for everyone. Provided anyone got a better idea to do this, it is welcome :)

3. Graphic design is not my passion, so understand that it is not the most beatiful app you will ever see :)

## Bugs to fix
1. For some combinations in the ComboBoxes of the "add_transaction" function, the app crashes. I haven't still tried to debug it very much, so maybe it is easy to solve with basic Qt knowledge.

## Further development
Taking into account that it is not finished, finishing it is the main goal here. However, these are the basic things that are still missing:

1.
